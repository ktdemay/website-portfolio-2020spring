My goal for this project was to create a clean looking minimalist website to show off the work we’ve done in this class. I’m a fan of the way minimalist websites look and wanted to make my own unique one. In this preview you see the basic layout of my landing page for the website. At the very top I added a navigation bar that will eventually be linked to the rest of the pages. I did this by making the navigation bar an unordered list that was styled to have no bulletpoints. I wanted there to be a big header section at the top with a unique color as the background. I did this using a similar solution as the one shown in class. I then want the rest of the page to be alternating colors with alternating text and picture layouts to create a clean looking effect. I accomplished this by creating two types of classes for the divs, one for odd stripes and one for even. I will probably end up changing the colors around but for now I’m rolling with a grayscale look just to start. I’m not sure what colors I want on the site yet so the grayscale is just helping me get something down and be able to look at it. My next step is to get all of the pictures and text to line up where I want. It currently is stuck in the middle instead of moving all the way to the right but I think I know how to fix it. Moving forward I’ll create three separate web pages that all have the same layout that corresponds with the homepage to keep the whole site looking cohesive.
